    <section id="static">
      <div id="static-text" class="textbox">
        <h2>position: static;</h2>
        <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.</p>
        <p>
          Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left,
          and right properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special
          way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="static-container container">
        <div class="static-box inline">This div is position static!</div>
        <div class="static-box inline">We go from top to bottom,</div>
        <div class="static-box inline">from left to right in the flow</div>
        <div class="static-box inline">
          Elements which are display: inline are happy to share their row
        </div>
        <div class="static-box">
          elements which are display: block; will always take up a whole row to
          themselves
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Relative section -->
    <section id="relative">
      <div id="relative-text" class="textbox">
        <h2>position: relative;</h2>
        <p>
          An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its
          normal position. Using position: relative opens up the use of top,
          right, bottom, left in CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
          relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from
          its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into
          any gap left by the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other use of position:relative is to allow child elements with
          position:absolute to relate to it. We'll come to this later!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="relative-container" class="container">
        <div id="relative-1" class="relative-box">left: 10, top:10</div>
        <div class="relative-box">no changes</div>
        <div class="relative-box">no changes</div>
        <div id="relative-2" class="relative-box">bottom:10, right: 10</div>
        <div class="relative-box">no changes</div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Fixed section -->
    <section id="fixed">
      <div id="fixed-text" class="textbox">
        <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
        <p>
          An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the
          viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the
          page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used
          to position the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would
          normally have been located.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="fixed-box">This div element has position: fixed</div>

      <!-- Absolute section -->
    </section>
    <section id="absolute">
      <div id="fixed-text" class="textbox">
        <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
        <p>
          An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the
          nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the
          viewport, like fixed).
        </p>
        <p>
          However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned
          ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page
          scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow,
          and can overlap elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="absolute-container" class="container">
        <div id="absolute-box">I'm positioned absolute!</div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Sticky section -->
    <section id="sticky">
      <div id="navbar">
        <a class="active" href="javascript:void(0)">Home</a>
        <a href="javascript:void(0)">News</a>
        <a href="javascript:void(0)">Contact</a>
      </div>
      <div id="sticky-text" class="textbox">
        <h2>position: sticky;</h2>
        <p>
          An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's
          scroll position.
        </p>

        <p>
          A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the
          scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset
          position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like
          position:fixed).
